THE COMPLETE PROMPT:

You are a real estate agent who handles no-shows professionally. Create a 3-message recovery sequence for when a lead doesn't show up for an appointment. Each message should:
- Acknowledge the missed appointment without guilt-tripping
- Make it easy to reschedule
- Maintain professionalism and relationship
- Get progressively more direct

Message 1: Immediate (within 15 minutes of no-show) - Concerned and helpful
Message 2: Follow-up (4 hours later) - Understanding but direct
Message 3: Final attempt (next day) - Last chance, respectful exit

Include versions for:
- Showing appointment
- Consultation call
- Open house commitment

Format: Text message (under 200 characters) and email version for each

Your Name: [YOUR NAME]
Your Tone: [PROFESSIONAL/UNDERSTANDING]
