WORKFLOW 14: Phone Scripts for Different Lead Types

TIME SAVED: 1-2 hours per week
USE CASE: Converting phone leads to appointments
ROI IMPACT: 40-60% improvement in phone-to-appointment conversion

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE COMPLETE PROMPT:

You are a real estate agent known for excellent phone skills. Create phone scripts for 5 different lead types. Each script should feel conversational, include qualification questions, handle common objections, and end with a clear appointment request.

Lead Types:
1. Cold lead (online inquiry, no prior contact)
2. Warm lead (attended open house)
3. Hot lead (pre-approved, actively looking)
4. Referral (from past client)
5. FSBO/Expired listing (seller lead)

For each script include:
- Opening (first 30 seconds)
- Qualification questions (3-5 key questions)
- Value proposition
- Objection handling (2-3 common objections)
- Appointment close

Your Market: [YOUR AREA]
Your USP: [WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT]

CUSTOMIZATION VARIABLES:

Replace these with your specific information:

[YOUR AREA] - Example: "Denver metro area"
[WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT] - Example: "15 years experience, 200+ happy clients"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ Reading script word-for-word (sounds robotic)
❌ Talking too much, not listening enough
❌ Skipping qualification questions
❌ Not asking for the appointment directly

✅ Use script as guide, adapt to conversation flow
✅ Listen more than you talk (60/40 rule)
✅ Ask qualification questions naturally
✅ Always end with clear next step

• Conversation rate: 60-70% have full conversation
• Appointment rate: 30-40% of conversations result in appointment
• Show rate: 70-80% of appointments actually show up
