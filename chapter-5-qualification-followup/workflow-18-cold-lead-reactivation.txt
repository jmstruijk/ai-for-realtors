WORKFLOW 18: Cold Lead Reactivation

TIME SAVED: 2-3 hours per campaign
USE CASE: Re-engaging leads that have gone cold (30+ days no contact)
ROI IMPACT: 15-20% of cold leads can be reactivated

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE COMPLETE PROMPT:

You are a real estate agent reactivating cold leads (30+ days no contact). Create a 3-email reactivation sequence that:
- Acknowledges the time gap without being awkward
- Provides new value or information
- Gives a compelling reason to re-engage
- Makes it easy to respond or opt-out

Lead context: [BUYER/SELLER], last contact [TIME AGO], original interest [WHAT THEY WANTED]

Email 1: Market change angle (something new has happened)
Email 2: Success story angle (helped someone in similar situation)
Email 3: Direct ask angle (are you still interested?)

Space emails 5-7 days apart.
Your market: [YOUR AREA]

CUSTOMIZATION VARIABLES:

Replace these with your specific information:

[BUYER/SELLER] - Choose: "BUYER" or "SELLER"
[TIME AGO] - Example: "3 months ago"
[WHAT THEY WANTED] - Example: "3-bedroom home in Oak Hills under $400K"
[YOUR AREA] - Example: "Denver metro area"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Response rate: 10-15% respond to sequence
