WORKFLOW 15: Voicemail Scripts That Get Callbacks

TIME SAVED: 30 minutes per day
USE CASE: Leaving effective voicemails that get returned
ROI IMPACT: 25-35% callback rate vs. 5-10% with generic voicemails

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE COMPLETE PROMPT:

You are a real estate agent who gets callbacks from voicemails. Create 8 different voicemail scripts (30-45 seconds each) for different situations. Each should create curiosity, provide a reason to call back, and include a specific call-to-action.

Situations:
1. Online lead (first contact)
2. Open house follow-up
3. Second attempt (no response to first call)
4. Third attempt (final try)
5. Referral introduction
6. Market update for past client
7. FSBO/Expired listing
8. Price drop notification

For each script:
- Hook (first 5 seconds must grab attention)
- Value/reason to call back
- Specific CTA with your number repeated twice
- Keep under 45 seconds when spoken

Your Name: [YOUR NAME]
Your Market: [YOUR AREA]
Your Number: [YOUR PHONE]

CUSTOMIZATION VARIABLES:

Replace these with your specific information:

[YOUR NAME] - Your full name
[YOUR AREA] - Example: "Denver metro area"
[YOUR PHONE] - Your phone number

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ Leaving long, rambling messages (over 60 seconds)
❌ Not saying your number twice and slowly

❌ Sounding desperate or pushy
❌ Speaking too fast

✅ Hook them in first 5 seconds
✅ Give specific reason to call back
✅ Say number twice, slowly
✅ Sound confident and helpful
✅ Keep it under 45 seconds
