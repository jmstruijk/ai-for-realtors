WORKFLOW 19: Objection Handling Scripts

TIME SAVED: 1-2 hours per week
USE CASE: Overcoming common buyer/seller objections
ROI IMPACT: 30-50% improvement in objection-to-close conversion

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE COMPLETE PROMPT:

You are a real estate agent who handles objections professionally and persuasively. Create responses to the 15 most common objections you hear. Each response should:
- Acknowledge the concern (show empathy)
- Reframe the objection (provide new perspective)
- Provide evidence or logic (support your position)
- Ask a question (move conversation forward)

Objections to address:
BUYER OBJECTIONS:
1. "We want to think about it"
2. "We want to see more houses first"
3. "We're not sure about the neighborhood"
4. "It's over our budget"
5. "We're worried about the market"

SELLER OBJECTIONS:
6. "Your commission is too high"
7. "We want to try FSBO first"
8. "We're not sure about the price"
9. "We want to wait for spring"
10. "Another agent said they could get more"

GENERAL OBJECTIONS:
11. "We're not ready yet"
12. "We need to talk to our [spouse/parents/etc.]"
13. "We're working with another agent"
14. "We're just looking"
15. "Can you lower your commission?"

Your market: [YOUR AREA]
Your experience: [YEARS/CREDENTIALS]

CUSTOMIZATION VARIABLES:

Replace these with your specific information:

[YOUR AREA] - Example: "Denver metro area"
[YEARS/CREDENTIALS] - Example: "15 years experience, 500+ transactions"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ Getting defensive or argumentative
❌ Talking over the objection without acknowledging it
❌ Using high-pressure tactics
❌ Not asking questions to understand the real concern

✅ Listen fully before responding
✅ Acknowledge their concern as valid
✅ Ask questions to uncover the real issue
✅ Provide evidence and logic, not just opinion

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUCCESS METRICS:

• Objection conversion rate: 30-50% (vs. 10-20% without scripts)
• Confidence level: Agents report feeling 80% more confident
• Close rate: 15-20% improvement overall
• Time to close: 25% faster (fewer objections = faster decisions)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUICK WIN (5 minutes):
1. Print responses to your 3 most common objections
2. Practice each response once out loud
3. Use on next 3 objections you hear
4. Expected result: 2x conversion rate on those objections
