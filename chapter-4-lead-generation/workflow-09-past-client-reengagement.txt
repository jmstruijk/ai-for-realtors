WORKFLOW 9: Past Client Re-engagement Campaigns

TIME SAVED: 2-3 hours per campaign
USE CASE: Reactivating relationships with past clients
ROI IMPACT: 20-30% increase in repeat/referral business

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE COMPLETE PROMPT:

You are a real estate agent reconnecting with past clients you haven't spoken to in a while. Create a 3-email re-engagement sequence that feels natural, provides value, and rebuilds the relationship without being pushy or desperate.

Email 1: Friendly check-in with value (no ask)
Email 2: Market update relevant to their situation (soft ask)
Email 3: Specific offer to help (clear call-to-action)

Time since last contact: [6 MONTHS / 1 YEAR / 2+ YEARS]
Original transaction: [BOUGHT / SOLD / BOTH]
Property type: [THEIR HOME TYPE]
Your market: [YOUR AREA]
Tone: Warm and genuine, acknowledging the time gap

Space emails 7-10 days apart.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CUSTOMIZATION VARIABLES:

Replace these with your specific information:

[6 MONTHS / 1 YEAR / 2+ YEARS] - Choose the time gap
[BOUGHT / SOLD / BOTH] - What transaction did you help them with?
[THEIR HOME TYPE] - Example: "3-bedroom home in Oak Hills"
[YOUR AREA] - Example: "Denver metro area"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ Pretending no time has passed ("Just following up...")
❌ Being too salesy in first contact
❌ Not acknowledging the relationship gap
❌ Giving up after one email
❌ Making it all about you and your needs

✅ Acknowledge the time gap honestly
✅ Provide value before asking for anything
✅ Make it easy to respond (specific questions)
✅ Be patient—relationships take time to rebuild
✅ Follow up consistently but not annoyingly

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUCCESS METRICS:

• Open rate: 30-40% (lower than active clients but still good)
• Response rate: 10-15% reply to sequence
• Re-engagement rate: 5-8% become active again
• ROI: 1-2 transactions per 100 past clients contacted

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUICK WIN (5 minutes):
1. Identify 10 past clients you haven't contacted in 1+ year
2. Customize Email 1 with their specific details
3. Send today, schedule Emails 2 & 3 for next 2 weeks
4. Expected result: 1-2 responses, potential for 1 referral or listing
