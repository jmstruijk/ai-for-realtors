WORKFLOW 6: Referral Request Scripts

TIME SAVED: 1-2 hours per month
USE CASE: Systematically requesting referrals from past clients
ROI IMPACT: 30-50% increase in referral business

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE COMPLETE PROMPT:

You are a real estate agent known for exceptional client service and strong referral business. Create 5 different referral request scripts for the following scenarios. Make each request feel natural, not pushy. Include a specific reason why NOW is a good time to refer, and make it easy for clients to take action.

Scenarios:
1. Recent closing (within 30 days)
2. 6-month post-closing check-in
3. Anniversary of closing (1 year)
4. Client mentions knowing someone who might buy/sell
5. Holiday/seasonal outreach

Your Unique Value: [WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT]
Recent Success: [SPECIFIC RECENT WIN]
Referral Incentive: [IF ANY - e.g., gift card, donation to charity]
Tone: Grateful and helpful, not desperate

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CUSTOMIZATION VARIABLES:

Replace these with your specific information:

[WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT] - Example: "White-glove service, 18-day average closing time"
[SPECIFIC RECENT WIN] - Example: "Just helped a family in Oak Hills close in 18 days"
[IF ANY] - Example: "$50 Starbucks gift card" or "$100 donation to local charity"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:

For Different Client Types:
• First-time buyers: Emphasize helping their friends avoid mistakes
• Move-up buyers: Mention helping with investment properties or downsizing parents
• Luxury clients: Focus on discretion and high-end service
• Investors: Ask for referrals to other investors or property managers

For Different Timing:
• Immediate post-closing: Gratitude-focused, light ask
• 3-6 months: Check-in focused, medium ask
• 1+ year: Relationship maintenance, stronger ask

For Different Incentives:
• Gift cards: "$50 Starbucks gift card for every referral"
• Charity donations: "I'll donate $100 to [Charity] in your name"
• Client events: "Exclusive invite to my annual client appreciation party"
• No incentive: "Your trust and referrals mean everything to me"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ Asking too soon (wait at least 2 weeks post-closing)
❌ Generic "Do you know anyone?" requests (be specific about who you help)
❌ Only asking once (systematic follow-up is key)
❌ Making it complicated (don't require forms or lengthy processes)
❌ Forgetting to thank them when referrals come in

✅ Make it easy: "Just reply with their name and number"
✅ Provide value first: "How's the house? Any issues I can help with?"
✅ Be specific: "I'm looking for 3 more buyers in [Neighborhood]"
✅ Follow up when you help their referral: "Thank you for sending [Name]!"
